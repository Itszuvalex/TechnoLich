/**
 * Persists a [TeamState] to [file], next to which it keeps `<file>.bak` (the previous good save) and, while writing,
 * `<file>.tmp`.
 *
 * Deliberately not vanilla `SavedData`: when vanilla fails to read saved data it hands out a fresh, empty instance and
 * later saves that empty instance over the unreadable file, wiping it. Here:
 * - [load] reads the file and, if it is unreadable, falls back to the backup; the unreadable file is then moved aside
 *   (`<file>.corrupt-<time>`) instead of being overwritten.
 * - If neither the file nor its backup can be read, both are left untouched and the store is not [writable]: the
 *   server runs with empty teams in memory and [save] refuses to write, so nothing on disk is lost. An administrator
 *   restores the data by hand.
 * - [save] writes to the temporary file, reads it back and decodes it to prove it is complete, copies the current
 *   file to the backup, then atomically moves the temporary file into place. A crash at any step leaves a readable
 *   file or backup.
