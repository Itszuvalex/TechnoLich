/**
 * The server's teams: the one place team state changes. Everything else reads [state] (an immutable snapshot) or asks
 * for a change through [change].
 *
 * - [change] runs one operation against the current state. The operation either returns a new valid state, which
 *   replaces the old one and marks the data dirty, or throws ([TeamException] for a refused request), leaving the
 *   state exactly as it was. There is no half-applied change.
 * - Changes must happen on the thread that [load]ed the data (the server thread).
 * - [save] writes the current snapshot through the [TeamStore], only when something changed.
